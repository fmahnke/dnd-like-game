The farm has seen better days, and yet the ground here is fertile enough for the family to do reasonably well, growing barley and wheat and keeping a small herd of sheep.\n\nDevek Yarl is being kept in a small bedroom on the upper storey of the farmhouse. He is a fair-haired freckled teenager with a deathly pallor. His heart rate and breathing are extremely slow, and his skin is cold to the touch. Watching over him are his tearful mother, Elista, and his eldest sister, Abella.",
